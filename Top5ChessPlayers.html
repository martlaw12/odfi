<b>Top 1<br></b>
<u>GM Magnus Carlsen<br></u>
2828 |
Norway<br><br>
To many, GM Magnus Carlsen is the best to ever play the game, although GMs Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer remain in the conversation. At any rate, the clear and remarkable point is that before turning 30 years old, Carlsen had already earned a spot at the top, and he has continued to dominate into his 30s.The 13-year-old Norwegian prodigy drew Kasparov and defeated GM Anatoly Karpov at the same event in 2004, one month before he became the second-youngest GM in history (and still eighth-youngest as of 2021). In 2009, he became the youngest player to break the 2800-rating threshold (a record only broken by GM Alireza Firouzja in 2021).<br><br>

Then Carlsen transitioned from young world-class player to all-time great. He captured the world number-one ranking in 2011 and still hasn’t let go of it as of May 2023. He won the world title in 2013 and has successfully defended it four times (2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021). Additionally, he has won multiple world titles in rapid and blitz time controls, achieved the highest rating ever, and racked up several elite tournament wins, including four Norway Chess victories and seven in Wijk aan Zee.<br><br>

The amazing part is it seems like there’s much more ahead for Carlsen. In October 2020 Carlsen's 125-game undefeated streak came to an end (he scored 42 wins and 83 draws during this streak), setting yet another world record. If he continues performing the way he has, Carlsen could create something truly legendary.
In an era of chess that’s more competitive than ever, he’s far ahead of the opposition. This despite voluntarily relinquishing the world championship in 2023, the first player to do so since Fischer.

<b>Top 2<br></b>
<u>GM Fabiano Caruana<br></u>
2795  |
United States<br><br>
The prodigy who broke the record held by GM Hikaru Nakamura for America's youngest chess grandmaster, Fabiano Caruana, has climbed the mountain of chess and reached the summit. This grandmaster has had a ranking as high as number-two in the world and has won numerous tournaments in his career. In 2018 the American faced GM Magnus Carlsen at the World Chess Championship in London in 2018, losing in the tiebreak playoffs. He is also a two-time U.S. chess champion.

<b>Top 3<br></b>
<u>GM Ding Liren<br></u>
2780 |
China<br><br>
Ding Liren is the reigning FIDE World Chess Champion after defeating GM Ian Nepomniachtchi in the 2023 World Championship. Like most world champions, a combination of dominance and close calls have defined Ding's career leading up to winning the title.

Ding won his first Chinese Chess Championship at the age of 16, making him the youngest to ever do so. In the 2017 and 2019 Chess World Cup, he became the first player in history to reach the finals twice in a row. His three Chinese titles are joined by two team gold medals and one individual gold medal at the Chess Olympiads (plus one team gold medal at the World Team Championships).

From August 2017 to November 2018, Ding held a 100-game unbeaten streak in top-level chess competition—the longest in history until GM Magnus Carlsen broke it in October 2019. In 2018, Ding entered the world’s top-five chess players (May) and broke the 2800-rating mark (September), and he remains in those categories today.

<b>Top 4<br></b>
<u>GM Hikaru Nakamura<br></u>
2778 |
United States<br><br>
Hikaru Nakamura was born December 9, 1987 in Hirakata, Japan. His family moved to the United States when he was just two years old, and the Stars and Stripes are the only national banner he has known as a chess player.

Nakamura has been one of the world’s top players for well over a decade. He was clearly the top American player for much of that time and is now a key contributor to one of the strongest chess scenes in the world.

He is a five-time U.S. champion, claiming the title in 2005, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2019. Nakamura was also a participant in FIDE’s 2004 World Championship tournament and a candidate for the world championship in both 2016 and 2022. He was also the 2022 Fischer Random World Champion. As of November 2022, he is the highest-rated blitz player in the world with a 2909 FIDE blitz rating.

<b>Top 5<br></b>
<u>GM Alireza Firouzja<br></u>
2777 | 
France<br><br>
Alireza Firouzja is an Iranian-born grandmaster who now plays for France. He is a world championship candidate and two-time Iranian champion.

In late 2019 and early 2020, Firouzja electrified the chess world with his second place finish in the World Rapid Championship (one point behind World Champion Magnus Carlsen) and his amazing 5/7 start at the 2020 Tata Steel tournament.

Firouzja's trajectory continued to shoot up in 2021, when he won the Riga Grand Swiss, scored 8/9 and the European Team Championships, and skyrocketed to #2 in the world rankings with a 2804 rating. His Grand Swiss victory qualified Firouzja for the 2022 Candidates Tournament at the age of 18, one of the youngest ever to achieve that feat, and Firouzja also broke the record for youngest player to surpass a 2800 rating.
